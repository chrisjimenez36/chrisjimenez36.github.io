### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was a favorite because it was the first lab we got to do. So from this lab I got happy that i was going to be working on coding. Lab 1 is was just getting the code to say hello and my name.

* Lab 7, part 2
    
    Lab 7, part 2 was also on of my top favorite. It was the parking rules and the time slots it had. I also liked how each date had a time frame on the parking. As of now lab 7, part 2 beats lab 1.

Lab 11, part 2

    Lab 11, part 2 now this one was my top favorite. In this lab we did the gussing game. where the player had to guess and show how many guesses they had left. Lab 11 was one of the labs i finshed quick which I liked. It was where I got to understand everything.
